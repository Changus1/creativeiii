- For this version of the creative lab I used Vue CLI to code the front end.
- I have the Home, Adopt, and Favorites pages.
- I created a mock data to simulate a database of adoptable animals. I also used this same method to create a rolling banner that is presented on the Home page.
- I also included a footer. 

Changes from the previous lab:
- I added a Spotlight section on the Home page, which will display a random adoptable pet, and a new subscription form that is included before the footer of all of the pages.
- I fixed the timer interval on the changing banner of the home page so that it will change every 6 seconds and the timer will reset when the user clicks forwards or backwards.
- I added a filter option on the Adopt page.
- I combined the favorites and contact page to more efficiently display information.
